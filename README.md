# Emoji-spammer
Made by Romain Sickenberg with ‚ù§Ô∏è


## Purpose

The goal is to flood a text box with text (or emoji in this case) inside a text box.

## How it works ?

With `java.awt.Robot;` üòâ, seriously, with Robot, who simulate a keyboard input and `java.awt.event.KeyEvent` for maping keys like this `KeyEvent.VK_SHIFT`.

### But whyy ?
