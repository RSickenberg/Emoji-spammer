Made by Romain Sickenberg with ‚ù§Ô∏è


## Purpose

The goal is to flood a text box with text (or emoji in this case) inside a text box.

## How it works ?

With `java.awt.Robot;` üòâ, seriously, with Robot, who simulate a keyboard input and `java.awt.event.KeyEvent` for maping keys like this `KeyEvent.VK_SHIFT`.

## But whyy ?

## Okay, so how it works ?

You have GUI ! üòÄ, you choose your Emoji (or other word), and check choose the number of loop or if you want the `:`

## Todo :

- GUI : Done !
- Better enter message in Whatsaap : In progress
- Maybe improve speed
