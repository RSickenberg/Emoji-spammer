# Emoji-spammer
Made by Romain Sickenberg with ❤️


## Purpose

The goal is to flood a text box with text (or emoji in this case) inside a text box.

## How it works ?

With `java.awt.Robot;` 😉, seriously, with Robot, who simulate a keyboard input and `java.awt.event.KeyEvent` for maping keys like this `KeyEvent.VK_SHIFT`.

## But whyy ?

## Okay, so how it works ?

Simple, on the Main, you can set up (V.0.1) whitch number of loop, and the emoji name, the markdown will be set inside Heart class, with the `:` (I put 80% of the dev time for this...)

You can, if you want, change the emoji name to spam your Girlfriend or just a friend with a Poop.
